                  <mat-panel-description> What payment methods are accepted?</mat-panel-description>
                </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                <p>Credit cards are the most widely accepted payment method for properties listed on Booking.com. Many properties also require users to provide a valid credit card to reserve bookings that aren’t paid for in advance.
                    Online payments
                    In many countries, Booking.com offers several alternative payment methods (e.g. PayPal, ApplePay, Klarna) in addition to credit cards. In certain markets, Booking.com also offers local payment methods (e.g. Venmo). The availability of digital payment methods may vary by country, region, and/or device used to book. We've listed the most common payment methods below.
                    Flexible payment methods (Buy now, pay later)
                    In some countries, Booking.com offers flexible payment options via third parties like Affirm, AfterPay, and Klarna. These methods allow travelers to split a payment into multiple installments, or delay payment to a later date. Short-term installment plans (up to 3-4 installments) are typically interest-free, while longer-term financing may include interest.
                    Available payment methods
                    The availability of payment methods may vary according to country, currency, region, and/or device used to book.</p>

                </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                <p>Every room or property has an individual policy determined by the property.
                    A “non-refundable” policy means a fee will apply if you decide to change or cancel your booking. This fee is mentioned during the booking process in the conditions and in the booking confirmation.
                    A “free cancellation” policy means you can change or cancel a booking for free, as long as you do it within the time frame specified by the property (e.g. “Cancel up to x days” or “Cancel before mm/dd/yy hh:mm”). This is mentioned in the conditions during the booking process and in the booking confirmation.</p>
